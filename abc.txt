Time stopped
The traffic lights don't change
I keep getting older
But we ain't moving on
 
They stay in the memories
That's why they don't change
Getting short-sighted
Open your eyes uh
 
I get it, everyone was like that back then
But why should I hear it now?
You think you're right
Nobody's right, only opinion
That was then, now please let me go
 
Everyday the same words, aren't you tired?
You don't remember saying that
 
Gone days
Why do you keep saying no?
Never mind the past ey
This is the new generation
go away
Gone days
